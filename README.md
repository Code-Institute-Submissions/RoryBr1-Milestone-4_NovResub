## Overview

TechZone is an e-commerce website featuring user *registration, login, product management,* and providing customers with the ability to place online *orders* and *checkout*/pay for them using the Stripe checkout platform.

The site also features a *Blog* section which allows logged-in users to read and *comment* on articles posted by the site administrator.

The website is fully responsive, utilizing simple and colourful design language and an intuitive information structure.
This project was built as part of the [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full-Stack Software Development course purely for educational purposes.

# UX

## Developer Goals
* Create an easy-to-use e-commerce website.
* Allow the end-user (customer) to register an account, login, add products to their cart, and purchase them.
* Create an intuitive interface for the site administrator to add, delete and edit products.
* Allow the end user to search products by search term, sort by price and other factors, and view products based on category.
* Provide links to social media pages run by the site owner.
* Create an easy-to-use contact form for customers or potential customers to send messages to the site owner.
* Create a simple blog system which allows the *administrator* to *add, edit* and *delete* blog posts.
* Create a simple *comments* section which allows logged-in users to post comments on *blog* posts.

## User Stories
1. As a _site administrator_, I want to upload products to the site for the _end-user_ to view and purchase. I want to be able to edit and delete these products if needed.
2. As a _site administrator_, I want to categorise products for ease of management and end-user browsing.
3. As a _site administrator_, I want to ensure that only I can alter the content of the website.
4. As a _site administrator_, I want to post reviews, news and opinion pieces on subject matter related to the site.
5. As an _end-user_, I want to browse products relevant to me; including searching through them using search terms, sort by price, and view items in specific relevant categories.
6. As an _end-user_, I want to be able to add multiple items to my *cart* and *checkout* for them with one payment.
7. As an _end-user_, I want to send an e-mail to the site owner about an order (or potential order).
8. As an _end-user_, I want to leave comments on the site's *Blog* posts to share my thoughts on the post.
9. As an _end-user_, I want to receive a confirmation e-mail when I place an order, so I know that my order has been received.
   
### How does the website function to meet the needs of the user, as described in the user stories?
1. The _Add New product_, _Edit_ and _Delete_ functions enable the administrator to fulfill these Create, Update and Delete functions.
2. The *Category* database model allows *Product* database objects to be sorted into separate categories.
3. The site requires administrator _authentication_ to reveal the administrator features such as adding, editing and deleting products and blog posts. When a user is signed in as a Django *superuser*, these options are presented throughout the site.
4. The *Blog* app allows admin users to add, edit and delete blog posts. 
5. The *All Products* page displays all products on the site. The searchbar allows users to search products using a search term. The category links (_All Products, Laptops, Phones, Tablets_) allow users to view products by category. The _Sort Products_ dropdown allows users to sort relevant products via different factors including price.
    A preview of the products is shown; when clicked, the user is directed to the full product page.
6. On individual product pages, users can click "*Add to Cart*" to add the product shown to their cart. A prompt is then shown, displaying the items in the user's cart, and giving them an option to *Checkout*. The Checkout process is easy and intuitive, and can be completed by users whether they are logged in or not.
7. The *Contact Us* link on the footer of each page directs the user to a functional Contact form which sends an e-mail to the site administrator's inbox.
8. Each *Blog* post page has a comment section at the bottom, which displays existing user comments and allows logged-in users to post new comments.
9. When a user completes the *Checkout* process, an order is created in the database and a confirmation e-mail is sent to the user.

## Design

* [Click here to view wireframes.](/static/readme-assets/wireframes.md) <br>

### Concept and Font Choice
The site is designed to appear clean, professional, and uncluttered while also appearing vibrant and welcoming.

The [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font is the primary font used throughout all sections of the site.

- [Hover.CSS](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - CSS library used for hover effects on site buttons.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Webfont library used for icons throughout the site.

### Colours

The colours used throughout the site are primarily the default BootStrap element colours; largely the _dark, success, danger_ and _info_ colour classes.

## **Existing Features**
The site's structure consists of
- **Homepage** Basic landing page with splash image and call-to-action button which leads to the main product page.
- **User registration**, fully functional and requiring the user to confirm their e-mail address by clicking a link which is emailed to them.
- **User login** which allows the user to login, with different site accessibilities between regular users (customers) and admins.
- **Products page** which displays all products, as well as search and sort-by-category functionality. When logged in as admin, relevant control panel links are also displayed.
    This uses the *get_products* python function.
- **Admin authentication** which allows the admin user to access product management and a shortcut to the Django Admin Panel.
    These utilize the *admin_login* and *logout* python functions.

    ![Admin menu](/static/readme-assets/admin-login.png)

    - _The admin-login page can be accessed by clicking the link at the top right of the navbar when logged in as admin._

    ![Admin add product page](/static/readme-assets/add-product-screenshot.png)
    - _Add Product page, accessible via the Admin menu._
- **Product Page** for each product which is loaded when a product is clicked on the homepage.
- **Delete Product** allows the admin to delete the given product.
- **Edit Product** allows the admin to edit the selected product.

    ![Edit and delete buttons](/static/readme-assets/edit-delete.png)

    - _Edit and Delete buttons as displayed when logged in as admin_
- **Messages** display a short message to the user confirming actions such as cart updates, product deletions, login actions etc.

## **Developer Notes**
- If you encounter the following error at any point running terminal commands in local deployment: ``` django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL:  role "qwmrksyzdlafcq" does not exist ``` , running ``` unset PGHOSTADDR ``` and re-trying the previous command will allow you to continue.

- Ensure your IDE Python linter is set to _flake8_, or you may encounter false errors related to object models not existing.

## **Known Bugs** 
- As of present, no critical bugs are present in the site.  
A previous version of the project returned would return *500 Server Error* upon loading *products.html* pages when attempting to show products that did not have an image file uploaded when created.   
This has been remedied by making the *Upload Image* field required on the *Add Product* page. However, a backend fix should be implemented in future versions in case a *product* object has its *image* property removed by accident.

## **Future Features**
- At present, individual *Blog* posts can only be viewed by users who are logged-in.    
This is to prevent an error which occurs when a guest user attempts to post a comment. While this fix is functional, it is not ideal; individual *Blog* posts should be viewable by guest users.   
In future developments, a workaround could be developed where the *Comment* form is hidden to guest users, and a prompt displayed in its place asking them to login.

- *Pagination* is an important feature on sites where pages display lists or multiple entries of objects.   
Since this project includes both *Products* list pages and *Blog post* list pages, pagination would be a vital feature if the amount of products and blog posts increases to the point where the browsing experience of the user becomes slow or tedious.

- Currently, the avatar images displayed next to *blog comments* are placeholders. In future developments, users should be given the option to upload a profile picture; this can then be rendered alongside their blog comment.

- Social media *Share* buttons should be added to *Products* and *Blog posts* pages to allow the users to easily share them via social media or messaging apps.

- A live chat which would allow the user to correspond with the site team in real time to solve customer queries.

- Stock-keeping functionality to allow the administrator to keep a track of stock of each item.
